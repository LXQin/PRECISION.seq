We include a number of functions for comparing the data distribution and differential-expression-analysis results for the test data (before and after normalization) with these for the benchmark data in this package.


## Relative Log Expression Plot
Relative log expression plot is the sample-specific boxplots showing the data deviation of each sample from the median counts across all samples.
```{r}
fig.RLE(data.test, data.group, "test without normalization")
```


## Venn Diagram
Venn diagram is used to identify the performance of different normalization methods based on intersection of DE genes using a pair of data.
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
benchmark.voom <- DE.voom(RC = data.benchmark, groups = data.group, Pval = 0.01)
test.voom <- DE.voom(RC = data.test, groups = data.group, Pval = 0.01)
fig.venn(benchmark.voom$p.val, test.voom$p.val, Pvalue = 0.01)
```


## Scatterplot for FNR and FDR
False Negative Rate (FNR) and False Discovery Rate (FDR) are calculated for each normalization method in the test data by comparing against the differential expression status based on the benchmark data as a gold standard. Scatter plot is used to plot the FNRs and FDRs among the normalization methods under study. Besides the benchmark-data-based gold standard, users also have the option of inputting an alternative golden standard (in the form of a list of miRNA/marker names). 
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
truthgene <- DE.voom(data.benchmark, data.group)$id.list
fig.FDR_FNR(data.test, data.group, truth = truthgene,
            MethodsCompare = c("norm.none", "norm.TMM", "norm.SVA", "norm.TC"))
```


## Concordance at The Top Plot
Concordance at the top plot compares the concordance of the p-values for differential expression assessed in the test data (before and after normalization) versus that in the benchmark data. Besides the nine normalization methods included in this package, additional normalization methods implemented by the user can also be used and assessed against the benchmark through inputting the p-values of DEA.
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
vsn.norm <- justvsn(data.test)
vsn.norm <- ifelse(vsn.norm<0, 1, vsn.norm)
vsn.pval <- DE.voom(vsn.norm, data.group)

fig.CAT(MethodsCompare = c("norm.none", "norm.TMM", "norm.SVA", "norm.TC"), MethodNew = "norm.vsn", pvalues = vsn.pval$p.val)
```


## Dendrogram for Method Clustering 
Dendrogram clusters the p-values for differential expression on the same dataset obtained through different normalization methods, which could be used to visualize the similarity among different normalization methods.
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
fig.dendrogram(MethodsCompare = c("norm.none", "norm.TMM", "norm.SVA", "norm.TC", "norm.RUVr"),  MethodNew = "norm.vsn", pvalues = vsn.pval$p.val)
```


## Integrated Function for All Visualization Tools
We also provide a function to provide all the figures mentioned above. Users can directly apply this function to compare their newly-devloped normalization methods to the existing methods.
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
vsn.norm <- vsn::justvsn(data.test)
vsn.norm <- ifelse(vsn.norm<0, 1, vsn.norm)
pip.fig(c("norm.none", "norm.TMM", "norm.SVA", "norm.TC", "norm.RUVr"),
        new.method.name = "vsn", normalized.test = vsn.norm)
```
