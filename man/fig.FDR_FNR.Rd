\title{Selection of normalization methods based on golden standards}
\usage{
fig.FDR_FNR(DEA, truth.DEA, title, subset = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{DEA}{a list of differential expression analysis results with the element names to be the normalization methods}

\item{truth.DEA}{differential expression analysis results from the benchmark (gold standard) obtained from DE.voom, DE.edge, or any method from the users by storing the results as same as DE methods in the package (including DE genes, p-values and log2 fold changes)}

\item{title}{Figure title}

\item{subset}{optional Vector of a subset of markers.
If given, the plot will be limited to the given subset
of markers. Leave \code{NULL} if all markers should be considered.}
}
\value{
figure for selection of normalization methods
}
\description{
Function for boxplot of FDR and FNR based on the DEA from the golden benchmark (typically
the data set \code{\link{data.benchmark}}) and the normalized test dataset (typically the
normalized or raw data set \code{\link{data.test}})
