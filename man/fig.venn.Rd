\title{Venn diagram for p-values}
\usage{
fig.venn(truth.DEA, DEA.res, Pvalue)
}
\arguments{
\item{truth.DEA}{differential expression analysis results from the benchmark (gold standard) obtained from DE.voom, DE.edge, or any method from the users by storing the results as same as DE methods in the package (including DE genes, p-values and log2 fold changes)}

\item{DEA.res}{p-values as a result from prior differential expression
analysis, e.g. using \code{\link{DE.voom}} or \code{\link{DE.edgeR}}.}

\item{Pvalue}{Cut-off point for p-values for identifying significant
differential expression.}
}
\value{
A Venn diagram
}
\description{
Venn diagram is used to identify the performance of different normalization methods based on intersection of differential expressed genes.
