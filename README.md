# DepthNorm: An R Package for Depth Normalization Methods

We propose the well-prepared datasets and pack commonly used normalization methods/functions in this package. The workflow of this package is: 
* Input dataset in the format of data frame or matrix with with columns for samples and raws for genes;
* Indicate the group for each sample using a vector of characters;
* Ensure the normalization and DEA method;
* Obtain the output including the DE genes and p values for each gene.
