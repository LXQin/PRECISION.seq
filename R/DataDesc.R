#' MiRNA Sequencing Benchmark Data
#'
#' Myxofibrosarcoma (MXF) and pleomorphic malignant fibrous histiocytoma (PMFH) are the two most common and aggressive subtypes of genetically complex soft tissue sarcoma.
#' This dataset includes three libraries used for sequencing 54 individual tumor samples. Library preparation and read capture were each processed by a single experienced technician in one run.

#' MiRNA Sequencing Test Data
#'
#' Myxofibrosarcoma (MXF) and pleomorphic malignant fibrous histiocytoma (PMFH) are the two most common and aggressive subtypes of genetically complex soft tissue sarcoma.
#' MiRNAs for the same 54 tumors used for the benchmark data were re-sequenced using neither uniform handling nor balanced library assignment.
#' In this study these samples were sequenced in the order of sample collection and processed in multiple runs.

#' Simulation Plan

#' @format A dataframe including information of allocation about 20,000 simulation datasets, which contains the proportion of differential expression and median of mean difference for each dataset.

#' Simulated Data Generation
#'
#' Function for generating simulated datasets according to different proportions of DE and medians of mean difference.
#' The range of DE proportion availiable is between 0 and 0.387, and the range of median of mean difference is between -2.52 and 4.59.
#'
#' @param proportion_L the lowest proportion of DE for simulated dataset filtering
#' @param proportion_R the highest proportion of DE for simulated dataset filtering
#' @param median_L the lowest median of mean difference for simulated dataset filtering
#' @param median_R the highest median of mean difference for simulated dataset filtering
#' @param numsets number of simulated datasets requested for returning (randomly drawn from the available sets). If it exceeds the maximum of availiable datasets, all the availiable sets will be returned.

#' @return list containing list of simulated benchmark data and test data
